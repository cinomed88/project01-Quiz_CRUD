# Project 01 - Quiz CRUD App 
(https://lucaswgong.com/portfolio/01/)
 
 - This is a simple CRUD app. You can create quizzes on the Admin page and solve them on the Student page.

 - To create a quiz, click the Add button, fill a question and answers and select one correct answer, and click the Save button. To update a quiz, change something and click a Update button. You can also remove a quiz by clicking a Delete button.

 - This is an upgraded version of one academic project. Deliberately, minimum libraries were used for it.


 ## Skills used : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL/MariaDB, Material-UI
 
 ## Issue & Solution:

 - Slow initiation : Change the data retrieving structure, XMLHttpRequest -> Axios
 - Worse UX : 3 Pages -> SPA (use React)   (is Doing)

 ## Future Work: 
 - Add Login function
