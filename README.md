# Project 01 - Quiz CRUD App 
(https://lucaswgong.com/portfolio/01/)
 
 - This is a simple CRUD app. You can create quizzes on the Admin page and solve them on the Student page.

 - To create a quiz, click the Add button, fill a question and answers and select one correct answer, and click the Save button. To update a quiz, change something and click a Update button. You can also remove a quiz by clicking a Delete button.

 - This is an upgraded version of one academic project. Deliberately, minimum libraries were used for it.


 ## Skills used : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, Bootstrap
 
 ## Future Work: 
 
 - XMLHttpRequest -> Fetch API, Change how to retrieve data (Cause of slow initial connection issue)
 - 3 pages -> SPA (use React) (For better UX)
 - Add Login function
