# Project 01 - Quiz CRUD App (ver 2.0.0)
(https://lucaswgong.com/portfolio/01/)
 
 - This is a simple CRUD app. You can create quizzes on the Admin page and solve them on the Student page.

 ## Skills used : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL/MariaDB, Material-UI
 
 ## Issue & Solution:

 - Slow initiation : Changed the data retrieving structure, and XMLHttpRequest -> Axios
 - Worse UX : 3 Pages -> SPA (used React, React-Router)
 - It is difficult to collect data and deiver them to the upper component when making a scoring system.

 ## Future Work: 
 - Add SignIn, SignUp function
